# Summary
The development of File Analysis Wizard occured in C GNU, and specialty focused specifically within the areas of file handling, error handling, and character manipulation. It demonstrates the use of 

# Skills Utilized
File descriptors, reading file content, and implementing logic to accurately count lines, words, and characters. Knowledge of pointers, file I/O operations, and error handling mechanisms is essential for understanding and modifying the code as well.

# How to Use
To utilize the File Analysis Wizard, follow these steps:

Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., gcc).

Execute the compiled program, providing the target filename as a command-line argument (e.g., './File_Analysis_Wizard sample.txt').

The program will analyze the specified file, calculating the number of lines, words, characters, and display the results.

Review the output to obtain statistical information about the target file.

Ensure that you have the necessary tools for C development, and customize any parameters within the code, such as the filename or file path, as needed.
